This project explores a cleaned version of a 2015 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) dataset where the goal was to better understand the relationship between lifestyle and diabetes in the United States and Puerto Rico. Ultimately this is a binary classification problem; if based on the features a person is pre-diabetic/diabetic or if they are not.
